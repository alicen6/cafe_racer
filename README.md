# Cafe Racer Model

This is a set of files for making a small cafe racer model based on a simple design I created. The files are meant to be printed on a 3D printer without support material. The wheels should be able to rotate and the handle bars will turn, though other parts will require some adhesive to keep in place.

## Materials

Almost any material choice in the printer should work fine. I was using a combination of PLA and ABS because of the colors I had available to me.

I suggest using super glue or epoxy of some kind for putting together the model in places that are not meant to move.

## Machine

Most of the parts are fairly small due to being designed for a machine with a build area of 6"  x 6" x 6" . I would suggest making sure that you are able to produce quality prints that are accurate before attempting to recreate this model.

## Files

There are several folders with similar files in them. The original Solidworks files are the files that I created while building and designing the model. These are not cut or oriented for printing.

There is a second folder with Solidworks files in it, where there appears to be more files than the first, with many duplicated labelled 'A' and 'B'. These are the Solidworks files of the parts that have been cut in order to be printed without needing support material.

The third folder has all the .STL files in it. These are the same files as the cut up Solidworks ones, but saved as STl's so that they can be imported into printing programs, such as Cura and Repetier and print directly. They are not oriented based on the work bed of a printer, so you would need to rotate some of them to the correct position.

The images folder has a few pictures of the model that I created so that you can understand what is supposed to go where and how the finished model should look.

## Process

In case it wasn't already obvious, download the files, print them with a printer in the colors/materials that you want, then fasten together parts with adhesive and enjoy.
